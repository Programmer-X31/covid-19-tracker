Preliminary safety data from a Phase 1 (ChiCTR2000030906; NCT04313127) clinical trial of 108 participants between 18 and 60 years old who will receive low, medium, and high doses of Ad5-nCoV has allowed the company to plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial, according to an announcement. The Phase 2 (ChiCTR2000031781) trial has identical inclusion criteria. Outcomes: A single dose of Ad5-nCoV protected against upper respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets, according to a paper published 14 August in Nature Communications. Results from the Phase 1 trial show a humoral and immunogenic response to the vaccine, according to a paper published in The Lancet. Adverse reactions such as pain (54%), fever (46%), fatigue (44%), headache (39%), and muscle pain (17%) occurred in 83% of patients in the low and medium dose groups and 75% of patients in the high dose group. In the Phase 2 trial, neutralizing antibodies and specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses were observed at all dose levels for most participants. Status: On 25 June, China’s Central Military Commission announced the military had been approved to use Ad5-nCoV for a period of 1 year, according to reporting in Reuters. The Phase 3 trial is underway at sites in Saudi Arabia and Russia.",

A Phase 1 trial (NCT04283461) of 105 healthy participants provided the basis for Moderna&rsquo;s investigational new drug application (IND), which was successfully reviewed by the FDA and set the stage for Phase 2 testing. A Phase 2 trial of 600 healthy participants evaluating 25 µg, 100 µg, and 250 µg dose levels of the vaccine was completed, and mRNA-1273 has advanced to a Phase 3 trial (NCT04405076). Study Design: A Phase 3 trial of 30,000 participants at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection who will receive a 100 µg dose of mRNA-1273 or placebo and then followed for up to 2 years (COVE trial; NCT04470427). Moderna  posted the full trial protocol for COVE on 17 September.  Outcomes: Animal studies - Results from a challenge in a mouse model showed mRNA-1273 prevented viral replication in the lungs, and neutralizing titers in the mouse model were similar in participants receiving 25 µg or 100 µg doses of the vaccine. A study of nonhuman primates challenged with SARS-CoV-2 published in the New England Journal of Medicine had neutralizing activity, and limited inflammation and lung activity after being administered the vaccine. A paper published in Nature also showed mRNA-1273 induced neutralizing antibodies in mice. Human studies - Phase 1 data published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed mRNA-1273 successfully produced neutralizing antibody titers in 8 participants who received either 25 µg or 100 µg doses. The response was dose dependent in 45 participants across 25 µg, 100 µg, and 250 µg dose levels. In participants with available antibody data, neutralizing antibody titers were on par with what has been in seen in convalescent sera from people who have successfully fought off COVID-19. The vaccine also appears to be safe for older adults, with participants who received two 25 μg or 100 μg doses of the vaccine experiencing mild or moderate effects consisting of fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and injection site pain, according to data from the Phase 1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Status: On 12 May, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to mRNA-1273. A Phase 3 trial of the vaccine is underway, which is being funded by Operation Warp Speed.",

			  "details": "Background: The BCG vaccine is indicated to prevent tuberculosis in those who have a higher risk of the disease. It has been implicated in helping to combat other infections outside TB by boosting the immune system to fight similar infections. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;reported&nbsp;the BCG vaccine may be effective against leprosy and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as buruli ulcer disease. Other papers have posited the vaccine is effective in preventing acute&nbsp;respiratory tract infections&nbsp;in elderly patients, other&nbsp;respiratory infection and sepsis. A non-peer reviewed paper posted in March 2020 on the preprint server medRxiv has suggested countries with BCG vaccination programs at childhood are&nbsp;faring better&nbsp;in the fight against COVID-19 compared with countries that do not require BCG vaccination. Trials: BCG vaccines are being studied in the randomized, controlled, Phase 3 BRACE trial, which aims to recruit 4,170 healthcare workers in hospitals in Australia (NCT04327206). Researchers in The Netherlands launched the randomized, parallel-assignment, phase 3 BCG-CORONA trial on 31 March and plan to enroll 1,500 healthcare workers to receive the BCG vaccine or placebo (NCT04328441). The Faustman Lab is currently evaluating the BCG vaccine&rsquo;s effectiveness in&nbsp;type 1 diabetes&nbsp;and is seeking funding to launch trial to assess whether the vaccine helps prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers, according to&nbsp;independent reporting&nbsp;from the&nbsp;New York Times. Outcomes: A paper published in Science Advances found countries that required BCG vaccination until the year 2000 had significantly slower growth rates of COVID-19 compared with countries that did not mandate the vaccine. However, a birth cohort study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases found the BCG tuberculosis vaccine did not have a protective effect against COVID-19 in more than 1 million individuals born in Sweden who received the vaccine. A letter published in the journal PNAS where researchers analyzed mortality rates in countries with higher rates of BCG vaccination such as Bolivia, Panama, Columbia, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany found that the negative association between the BCG vaccination and COVID-19 related deaths appears to be diminishing. Status: Trials are still currently recruiting.",

The companies have selected the modRNA candidate BNT162b2 to move forward in a Phase 2/3 trial. &nbsp; Study Designs: A Phase 1/2 trial in the US and Germany of 200 healthy participants between aged 18-55 years, with a vaccine dose range of 1 &micro;g to 100 &micro;g is currently recruiting (NCT04380701) as is a Phase 2/3 trial of about 32,000 healthy participants&nbsp;(NCT04368728). &nbsp; Outcomes:&nbsp;On 20 August, Pfizer and BioNTech researchers posted non-peer-reviewed data showing similar immunogencity between BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 but fewer adverse effects with BNT162b2. Another&nbsp;study of BNT162b1&nbsp;was reported 1 July on the non-peer-reviewed preprint server medRxiv and later published in the journal Nature. Robust immunogenicity was seen after vaccination at all three doses (10 &mu;g, 30 &mu;g and 100 &mu;g). Adverse events were elevated at the highest dose; therefore, participants did not receive a second dose at that level. Participants who received two doses between 1 and 50 µg of BNT162b1 had \"robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses,\" according to a paper published in Nature on 30 September. Pre-clinical results of BNT162b2 posted to the pre-print server bioRxiv showed the vaccine had \"protective anti-viral effects in rhesus macaques, with concomitant high neutralizing antibody titers and a TH1-biased cellular response in rhesus macaques and mice.\"   Status: Pfizer and BioNTech have received FDA Fast Track designation for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2. BNT162b2 was&nbsp;selected&nbsp;to advance to a Phase 2/3 safety study &quot;based on the totality of available data from our preclinical and clinical studies, including select immune response and tolerability parameters. The companies have asked the FDA to consider an expanded protocol for the Phase 3 trial to include up to 44,000 participants.
